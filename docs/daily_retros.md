# Daily Retros / Stand Ups

## Saturday 10/29/2022
Today we:
    - Took time to research more about TypeScript (going through the Scrimba course) 
    - and will begin conversation around how we will want to implement TS into our project

To Do:
    - Route our TS implementation
    - Build our Wireframe
    - Plan Iterations
    - Walk through API in depth - Will want to see what genres can actually be pulled up

Thoughts:
    - Catalyst: fade-in feature?
    - Connor: 
    - Will: 
    - Dani: start off with just clicking one Genre to start, in iteration1?

## Monday 10/31/2022
Today we:
    - Took time to research more about TypeScript (going through the Scrimba course) superr 
    - and will begin conversation around how we will want to implement TS into our project

To Do:
    - Route our TS implementation
    - Build our Wireframe
    - Plan Iterations
    - Walk through API in depth - Will want to see what genres can actually be pulled up

Thoughts:
    - Catalyst: fade-in feature?
    - Connor: We will need to program what tracks get played to the single playback player, whether a track from the random generator or from the queue.
    - Will: 
    - Dani: 
        - We will need to pick tracks based off of Jamendos 'Featured' list for their most reliable tracks
        - also, pick from their selected genres they feature on their website. This API won't have every genre a users searches; it would be best for us to just showcase what Jamendo has.
