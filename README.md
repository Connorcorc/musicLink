# Vibe Street - Mod 3 team "Stretch Tech" project by Catalyst, Connor, Dani & Will

## This project was designed to have us learn a new technology by implementing it in an app that also consumes an API. We chose TypeScript and an API from Jamendo that gvae us access to a massive libarary of underground music. Since 3/4ths of our team are DJs, our original MVP had us designing a music app that mimics the music selection and queue process one does while DJing. Unfortunately we came into a lot of problems along the way and we had to dial back our MVP to a more simplistic music playlist generator. Even then there are aspects of our app that do not meet functionality standards.

## TypeScript
Speaking personally - Cat here - I do not like TypeScript. I find it to be neurotic and damnding. It got in my way more than it helped. I don't feel that there's anything we accomplished with TS that we couldn't have done with less issues with vanilla/React JS.

## API
The API we used provides a huge amount of information about each track and gives a lot of search options. We had to wittle our searches down to just genre.
