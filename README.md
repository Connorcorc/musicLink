## About The Project

An app for music lovers, made by music lovers. We wanted a place to be able to go and get a playlist started with the music we're in the mood to vibe to at the moment.

## Project Spec

Vibe Street is a music application that allows you to choose a category and matches you with a random playlist, built in week 16 of [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) front-end engineering program. The goals of this [group project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/stretch.html) were to research and implement Typescript for the first time. We utilized the Jamendo API which gave us access to a massive library of underground music.


- Utilize React and React Router
- Test the UI/UX using Cypress
- Utilize Lighthouse and Wave for accessibility
- Make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data
- Implement error handling

## Reflections

The project was very ambitious from the beginning. We intended to pull a short list of songs that could be previewed and added to a queue, while allowing the list to be updated with new songs. After getting into the code, we realized this was a bit more than we would be able to accomplish in the time given for the project, and decided to scale back to an app that allows you to select a type of music and retrieve a selection of 50 songs. 

The pain points in this project revolved around learning a new technology to implement in such a short time. While TypeScript seemed a bit daunting at first, we eventually discovered that it is useful for developer empathy for anyone that works on the project after us, while also allowing us to know if the information we are passing through is the correct information. 

As a team we're proud of what we were able to accomplish despite our difficulties. The app we created has some potential; it serves up good jams and tough lessons.
