# Vibe Street - Mod 3 team "Stretch Tech" project by Catalyst, Connor, Dani & Will

This project was designed to have us learn a new technology by implementing it in an app that also consumes an API. We chose TypeScript and an API from [Jamendo](https://www.jamendo.com/start) that gave us access to a massive libarary of underground music. Since 3/4ths of our team are DJs, our original MVP had us designing a music app that mimics the music selection and queue process one does while DJing. Unfortunately we came into a lot of problems along the way and we had to dial back our MVP to a more simplistic music playlist generator. Even then there are aspects of our app that do not meet the functionality we aimed for.

## Difficulties
Our biggest challenge was losing a team member about halfway through the project. Our project was ambitious from the jump and a shortage of man-power/hours was detrimental to our production schedule. A day before the project was due, we came together as a team and reevaluated our ability to finish what we had started. We agreed it would be pertinant to scale back our app to a more streamlined functionality. I think this pivot saved us some headaches in the final stretch.
We were able to aknowledge our frustrations with the situation while still maintaining a professional demeanor and giving space to our team meber during a difficult time.

Speaking personally - Cat here - I do not like TypeScript. I found it to be neurotic and damnding. It got in my way more than it helped. It was very difficult to gain any collaborative momentum while fighting against it's strict rules. I don't feel that there's anything we accomplished with TS that we couldn't have done with less issues using vanilla JS & React. /rant

As a team we're proud of what we were able to accomplish despite our difficulties. The app we created has some potential; it serves up good jams and tough lessons.
